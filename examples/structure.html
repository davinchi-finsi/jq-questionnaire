    <div class="markdown-wrapper"><h2>jqQuiz</h2>
<h3>Overwiew</h3>
<p>jqQuiz works reading the HTML instead of use a JSON to provide more freedom over the markup as other jquery plugins do (jquery accordion for example), you choose the way to render it!\</p>
<p>jqQuiz is divided in small pieces, each piece has a specific rol inside the quiz, this rol is specified by an attribute of type <code>data-jq-quiz-**</code>, the rest of the markup is totally up to you!\</p>
<p>So, if you don't want to include a description, simply remove it! So easy.\</p>
<p>To simplify the creation of the markup, we provided some pug mixins, you only have to call the mixin of the element you want to place!. For more info please see <a href="./mixins.html">mixins</a>.\</p>
<h3>Structure &amp; Roles</h3>
