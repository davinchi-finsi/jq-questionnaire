                ## jqQuiz
                ### Overwiew
                jqQuiz works reading the HTML instead of use a JSON to provide more freedom over the markup as other jquery plugins do (jquery accordion for example), you choose the way to render it!\

                jqQuiz is divided in small pieces, each piece has a specific rol inside the quiz, this rol is specified by an attribute of type `data-jq-quiz-**`, the rest of the markup is totally up to you!\

                So, if you don't want to include a description, simply remove it! So easy.\

                To simplify the creation of the markup, we provided some pug mixins, you only have to call the mixin of the element you want to place!. For more info please see [mixins](./mixins.html).\

                ### Structure & Roles
                Most of the markup is totally free but, of course, a little structure must be provided.\
